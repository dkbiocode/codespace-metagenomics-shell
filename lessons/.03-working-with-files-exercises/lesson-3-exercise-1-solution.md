> ## Exercise 1: Make backup folder with write-protected permissions
>
> Starting in the `/workspaces/codespace-metagenomics-shell/dc_workshop/data/untrimmed_fastq` directory, do the following:
> 1. Make sure that you have deleted your backup directory and all files it contains.  
> 2. Create a copy of each of your FASTQ files. (Note: You'll need to do this individually for each of the four FASTQ files. We haven't
> learned yet how to do this
> with a wildcard.)  
> 3. Use a wildcard to move all of your backup files to a new backup directory.   
> 4. Change the permissions on all of your backup files to be write-protected.

> 1. `rm -r backup`  
> 2. `cp JC1A_R1.fastq JC1A_R1-backup.fastq`, `cp JC1A_R2.fastq JC1A_R2-backup.fastq`, `cp JP4D_R1.fastq JP4D_R1-backup.fastq`  
> and `cp JP4D_R2.fastq JP4D_R2-backup.fastq` 
> 3. `mkdir backup` and `mv *-backup.fastq backup`
> 4. `chmod -w backup/*-backup.fastq`   
> It's always a good idea to check your work with `ls -l backup`. You should see something like:
