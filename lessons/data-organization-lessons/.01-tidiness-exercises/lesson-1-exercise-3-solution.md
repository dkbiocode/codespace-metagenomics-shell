> ## Exercise 3: Ethical considerations in microbiome studies
> Microbiome knowledge is humanity's global heritage and must be ruled by ethical principles such as do good, do not harm, respect, and act justly.
> While studying the human microbiome, there are particular concerns. For example, if you discover an infection such as HIV in the blood microbiome, would you inform the participants? What If they did not want to know? Following these principles, what other ethical considerations can you think about human microbiomes?
>

> ## Solution
> 1. Respect: Ask participants to sign explicit prior informed consent.
> 2. Do good: Share the data but protect participant's privacy
> 3. Do no harm: establish a policy about results communications.
> 4. Do no harm: Consider the Invasiveness of sampling and minimize the risk
> 5. Act justly: Favor diversity of subjects and justice
