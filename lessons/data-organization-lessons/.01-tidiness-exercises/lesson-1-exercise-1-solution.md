[Back to exercise 1](../01-tidiness.md#exercise-1)

> ## Exercise 1
> With the person next to you, discuss:
>
> What kinds of data and information have you generated before you sent your DNA/RNA off for sequencing?
>

> ## Solution
> Types of files and information you have generated:
> - Spreadsheet or tabular data with the data from your experiment and
>   whatever you were measuring for your study.
> - Lab notebook notes about how you conducted those experiments.
> - Spreadsheet or tabular data about the samples you sent for sequencing.
> Sequencing centers often have a particular format they need
> with the name of the sample, DNA concentration, and other information.
> - Lab notebook notes about how you prepared the DNA/RNA for sequencing and what
> type of sequencing you are doing, e.g., paired-end Illumina HiSeq.
> There likely will be other ideas here too.
> Was this more information and data than you were expecting?
