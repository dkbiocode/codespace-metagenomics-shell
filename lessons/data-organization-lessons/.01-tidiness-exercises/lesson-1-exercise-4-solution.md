## Solution to Lesson 1 Exercise 4

> ## Exercise 4: Spreadsheet organization
> This is a potential spreadsheet data generated about a sequencing experiment. With the person next to you, for about 2 minutes, discuss some problems with the spreadsheet data shown above. You can look at the image or download the file to your computer via this [link](https://github.com/datacarpentry/organization-genomics/raw/gh-pages/files/Ecoli_metadata_composite_messy.xlsx) and open it in a spreadsheet reader like Excel.

> ## Solution
> There are a few potential errors to be on the lookout for in your own data and data from collaborators or the Internet. Suppose you are aware of the errors and the possible negative effect on downstream data analysis and result interpretation. In that case, it might motivate you and your project members to try and avoid them. Making small changes to how you format your data in spreadsheets can greatly impact efficiency and reliability when it comes to data cleaning and analysis.

> - Using multiple tables
> - Using multiple tabs
> - Not filling in zeros
> - Using problematic null values
> - Using formatting to convey information
> - Using formatting to make the datasheet look pretty
> - Placing comments or units in cells
> - Entering more than one piece of information in a cell
> - Using problematic field names
> - Using special characters in data
> - Inclusion of metadata in the data table
> - Date formatting

> You can keep exploring issues on the metadata file in the [Data Carpentry Ecology spreadsheet lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/02-common-mistakes/). Not all are present in this example. Discuss with the group what they found. Some problems include not all data sets having the same columns, datasets split into their own tables, color to encode information, different column names, and spaces in some columns names. Here is a "clean" version of the same spreadsheet:
