> ## Exercise 1
>
> Before we go any further, here are some important questions. If you are learning at a workshop,
> please discuss these questions with your neighbor.
>
>
> **Working with sequence data**
>
> What challenges do you think you'll face (or have already faced) in working with a large sequence dataset?
> Where/how will you (did you) analyze your data - what software, what computer(s)?
> What is your strategy for saving and sharing your sequence files?
> How can you be sure that your raw data has not been unintentionally corrupted?
>

> ## Solution
> With large datasets it is hard to have enough storage space for your data and your results,
> and it is hard to anticipate how much disc space and processing time you need for every step of
> your pipelines, including intermediate files and results.
> It is hard to identify errors when you have too many files and too many observations in a spreadsheet.
> Some programs may not work or perform poorly with many files.
> Data can be protected by removing file permissions and having copies.
