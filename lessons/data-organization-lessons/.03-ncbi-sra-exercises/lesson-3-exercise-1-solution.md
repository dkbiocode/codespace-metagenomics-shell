## Solution to Lesson 3 Exercise 1

[Back to exercise 1](../03-ncbi-sra.md#exercise-1)

> ## Exercise 1
>
> 1. What was the sequencing platform used for this experiment?
> 2. What samples in the experiment contain
> [paired end](http://www.illumina.com/technology/next-generation-sequencing/paired-end-sequencing_assay.html)
> sequencing data?
> 3. What other kind of metadata is available?
>

> 1. The Illumina sequencing platform was used, shown in the column "Platform". The column "Instrument"
> shows which type of Illumina sequencer was used, in this case, Illumina MiSeq.
> 2. The "LibraryLayout" column shows that all samples contain paired-end data.
> 3. Technology and instruments are good examples of the types of metadata that can exist for a sequenced biological sample.
> There is technical information, like "Assay Type" and "DATASTORE filetype", information about the sequences
> like "Bases" and biological metadata like "environment_(biome)" and "potassium_ppm".
