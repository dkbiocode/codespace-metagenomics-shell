## Using GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

This workshop can be run directly in GitHub Codespaces, a cloud-based development environment. This is the recommended approach as it requires no local installation.

To get started:
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Select "Open with Codespaces"
4. Click "New codespace"

Once the Codespace is ready, you'll have access to a terminal with all the necessary tools and data pre-configured.

## Alternative: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This workshop can also be run on pre-imaged Amazon Web Services (AWS) instances. For information about using AWS, see the
[setup instructions](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/metagenomics-workshop/setup.html) on the main workshop page.
